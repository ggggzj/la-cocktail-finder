## Data Structure

The application uses a comprehensive data model for cocktail bars including:
- Basic information (name, address, coordinates)
- Ratings and price ranges
- Opening hours for each day
- Cocktail specialties and atmosphere tags
- User reviews and ratings
- Contact information and websites

## Sample Data

The app comes pre-loaded with 5 popular LA cocktail bars:
- The Varnish (Downtown speakeasy)
- Broken Shaker (Tropical poolside bar)
- Death & Co (Award-winning cocktail lounge)
- Black Rabbit Rose (Magic-themed bar)
- Harvard & Stone (Vintage-style lounge)

## Integrating Real APIs

To make this application production-ready with real data, consider integrating these APIs:

### Recommended APIs for Bar/Restaurant Data:
- **Google Places API** - For comprehensive business information, ratings, and photos
- **Yelp Fusion API** - For reviews, ratings, and business details
- **Foursquare Places API** - For venue information and user tips
- **Mapbox API** - Alternative to OpenStreetMap with more styling options

### API Integration Steps:
1. **Replace Sample Data**: Update `src/data/sampleData.ts` with API calls
2. **Add API Keys**: Create a `.env` file for API credentials
3. **Implement Data Fetching**: Add services in `src/services/` for API calls
4. **Update Types**: Modify `src/types/index.ts` to match API response schemas
5. **Add Loading States**: Implement loading and error handling in components

### Example API Service Structure:
```typescript
// src/services/placesApi.ts
export const fetchBarsNearLocation = async (lat: number, lng: number) => {
  // Implement Google Places API call
};

export const getBarDetails = async (placeId: string) => {
  // Fetch detailed information
};
```

### Environment Variables:
```bash
# .env
VITE_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_YELP_API_KEY=your_yelp_key_here
```

## Future Enhancements
